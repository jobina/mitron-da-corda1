<p>A commodity contract represents an amount of some commodity, tracked on a distributed ledger. The design of this
contract is intentionally similar to the <a href="../-cash/index.html">Cash</a> contract, and the same commands (issue, move, exit) apply, the
differences are in representation of the underlying commodity. Issuer in this context means the party who has the
commodity, or is otherwise responsible for delivering the commodity on demand, and the deposit reference is use for
internal accounting by the issuer (it might be, for example, a warehouse and/or location within a warehouse).</p>
<p>This is an early stage example contract used to illustrate non-cash fungible assets, and is likely to change significantly
in future.</p>
