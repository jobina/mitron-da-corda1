<p>Clients must connect to us with a username and password and must use TLS. If a someone connects with
<a href="../-artemis-messaging-component/-n-o-d-e_-u-s-e-r.html">ArtemisMessagingComponent.NODE_USER</a> then we confirm it's just us as the node by checking their TLS certificate
is the same as our one in our key store. Then they're given full access to all valid queues. If they connect with
<a href="../-artemis-messaging-component/-p-e-e-r_-u-s-e-r.html">ArtemisMessagingComponent.PEER_USER</a> then we confirm they belong on our P2P network by checking their root CA is
the same as our root CA. If that's the case the only access they're given is the ablility send to our P2P address.
In both cases the messages these authenticated nodes send to us are tagged with their subject DN and we assume
the CN within that is their legal name.
Otherwise if the username is neither of the above we assume it's an RPC user and authenticate against our list of
valid RPC users. RPC clients are given permission to perform RPC and nothing else.</p>
