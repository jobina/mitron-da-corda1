<p>Modelled on <a href="#">ThreadBox</a>, but with support for waiting that is compatible with Quasar <a href="#">Fiber</a>s and <a href="../-mutable-clock/index.html">MutableClock</a>s.</p>
<p>It supports 3 main operations, all of which operate in a similar context to the <a href="#">locked</a> method
of <a href="#">ThreadBox</a>.  i.e. in the context of the content.</p>
<ul><li><a href="read.html">read</a> operations which acquire the associated lock but do not notify any waiters (see <a href="read-with-deadline.html">readWithDeadline</a>)
and is a direct equivalent of <a href="#">ThreadBox.locked</a>.</li>
<li><a href="write.html">write</a> operations which are the same as <a href="read.html">read</a> operations but additionally notify any waiters that the content may have changed.</li>
<li><a href="read-with-deadline.html">readWithDeadline</a> operations acquire the lock and are evaluated repeatedly until they no longer throw any subclass
of <a href="../../net.corda.core/-retryable-exception/index.html">RetryableException</a>.  Between iterations it will wait until woken by a <a href="write.html">write</a> or the deadline is reached.  It will eventually
re-throw a <a href="../../net.corda.core/-retryable-exception/index.html">RetryableException</a> if the deadline passes without any successful iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The construct also supports <a href="../-mutable-clock/index.html">MutableClock</a>s so it can cope with artificial progress towards the deadline, for simulations
or testing.</p>
<p>Currently this is intended for use within a node as a simplified way for Oracles to implement subscriptions for changing
data by running a flow internally to implement the request handler (see <a href="#">NodeInterestRates.Oracle</a>), which can then
effectively relinquish control until the data becomes available.  This isn't the most scalable design and is intended
to be temporary.  In addition, it's enitrely possible to envisage a time when we want public <a href="#">FlowLogic</a>
implementations to be able to wait for some condition to become true outside of message send/receive.  At that point
we may revisit this implementation and indeed the whole model for this, when we understand that requirement more fully.</p>
<p>TODO: We should consider using a <a href="#">Semaphore</a> or <a href="#">CountDownLatch</a> here to make it a little easier to understand, but it seems
    as though the current version of Qasar does not support suspending on either of their implementations.</p>
