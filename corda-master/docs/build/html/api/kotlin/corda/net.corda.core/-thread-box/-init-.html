<p>A threadbox is a simple utility that makes it harder to forget to take a lock before accessing some shared state.
Simply define a private class to hold the data that must be grouped under the same lock, and then pass the only
instance to the ThreadBox constructor. You can now use the <a href="locked.html">locked</a> method with a lambda to take the lock in a
way that ensures it'll be released if there's an exception.</p>
<p>Note that this technique is not infallible: if you capture a reference to the fields in another lambda which then
gets stored and invoked later, there may still be unsafe multi-threaded access going on, so watch out for that.
This is just a simple guard rail that makes it harder to slip up.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>private class MutableState { var i = 5 }
private val state = ThreadBox(MutableState())</p>
<p>val ii = state.locked { i }</p>
